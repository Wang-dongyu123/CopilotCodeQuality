/**https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-string-into-substrings-with-values-at-most-k/ */
//You are given a string s consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and an integer k.
//A partition of a string s is called good if:
//	Each digit of s is part of exactly one substring.
//	The value of each substring is less than or equal to k.
//Return the minimum number of substrings in a good partition of s. If no good partition of s exists, return -1.
//Note that:
//	The value of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer. For example, the value of "123" is 123 and the value of "1" is 1.
//	A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "165462", k = 60
//Output: 4
//Explanation: We can partition the string into substrings "16", "54", "6", and "2". Each substring has a value less than or equal to k = 60.
//It can be shown that we cannot partition the string into less than 4 substrings.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "238182", k = 5
//Output: -1
//Explanation: There is no good partition for this string.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= s.length <= 105
//	s[i] is a digit from '1' to '9'.
//	1 <= k <= 109
